# Predictive-Modelling-for-Diabetes-Related-Hospital-Readmissions
Implemented custom logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and neural network models to predict diabetes-related hospital readmissions, first optimizing the data through robust preprocessing and feature engineering, resulting in a 63% classification accuracy for the neural network model.
